### Overview

 The Craft & Technology Department aims to develop confident learners who enjoy learning by maximizing student learning through differentiated approaches based on students’ individual level of readiness. To provide students with a rich and enjoyable learning experience, students learn-by-doing through projects that are set around authentic learning contexts that are relatable to students.

The project tasks are designed to take on a spiral progression from lower secondary to upper secondary so that students are provided with the necessary scaffolds to ensure that the pace of progression is manageable. E-resources are also provided to encourage self-directed learning among our students. These affordances also allow our students to learn at their own pace.

Through the experience of project-based learning, our students will develop:

* Empathy and related problem-solving skills
* Collaboration and relationship-management skills
* Critical and inventive thinking skills
* Self-regulation and Self-management skills
* Self-expression and communication skills through musical and visual means

### Design & Technology (D&T)

The Design & Technology curriculum uses design-and-make projects to learn content and skills in an integrative approach via the design process. From the enactment of the design process, we aim to bring out the six essential dimensions that are characteristic of learning in D&T. These six essential dimensions are as follows:

1.  **Basic Design knowledge** which consists of ergonomics and anthropometry; design elements and design principles; influence of social, cultural, economic and sustainable factors, and designers’ responsibilities.
2.  **Basic Technology** such as structures, mechanisms, electronics and simple control systems is leveraged upon to create designs that can achieve their desired function.
3.  **Project-driven Knowledge and Skills** to self-initiate learning about areas related to the real-world design context of their projects.
4.  **Design Thinking** as an amalgamation of thought processes when seeking solutions.
5.  **Doodling & Sketching** to visually explore, generate, reason and develop design solutions.
6.  **3D Manipulation** which includes the testing and evaluating of ideas using quick mock-ups and constructing a prototype with resistant materials.

### Nutrition and Food Science (NFS)

The Food & Consumer Education programmes at Lower Secondary and Nutrition and Food Science at Upper Secondary programmes are specifically designed to provide positive experiences and develop passion for learning. Classroom activities are designed to nurture critical and creative thinking, encouraging the use of information technology and imbue a sense of national identity. Practical work in the classroom takes on an investigative approach where students use fundamental principles to design and create products to meet specific needs.

### Music

The Lower Secondary Music programme prepares students for a well-rounded music education focusing on preparing our students with subject knowledge in the Popular Culture (Music). We aim to progressively develop musicianship competencies by exposing our students to a practice-based learning environment while they learn to play a wide range of instruments. The programme culminates with a song writing module whereby students will have the opportunity to participate in the Singapore Youth Festival: Youth Station Project Song writing Festival with their original song composition.

### Art

The Art programme aims to enable students to enjoy art, communicate visually, and make meaning through connecting with society and culture. These are done through the learning of the Context of Art-making, Artistic Processes, Media and Visual Qualities.

At the lower secondary level, we expose our students to a variety of materials and mediums. We also create opportunities for them to work both individually and collaboratively in creating and presenting their work. They go through processes that range from conceptualisation to making, to sharing their works with others and getting others’ feedback.

Our upper secondary programme aims to develop independence, ownership, and the spirit of experimentation within students to enable them to push the boundaries of visual arts. These are done through a deepened experience on materials and mediums, outdoor drawing experiences, learning journeys, and the opportunity to curate and exhibit their works in the art gallery.

Students who are artistically-inclined and passionate about Art may apply for our Enhanced Art Programme at the end of Secondary 2. More information on the admission criteria and programme can be found under the ‘School Distinctive Programme’ tab on our website.
