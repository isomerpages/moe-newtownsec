**Objective of Education &amp; Career Guidance (ECG)**
* To prepare Newtowners for the world beyond secondary school life

<u>**Programmes**</u><br>
**Upper Sec ECG Fair:**<br>
Objectives:
* To showcase the changing landscape of the world of careers
* To share the significance of having the right mindset, values and skills in preparing for the future
* To inspire students to be forward-thinking and resilient in responding to future challenges

The school organises an annual Upper Sec ECG Fair for all Sec 3-5 students, where speakers from post-secondary education institutions as well as various industry partners are invited to provide insights on the ever-changing world of work. Students get to choose the talks they would like to listen to and this provides them the ownership over their own learning.

**Sec 3 Work Attachment Programme:**<br>
Objectives:
* To allow students the opportunity to appreciate the myriad of different jobs available in the various sectors
* To provide students the first-hand experience in the working world
* To develop life skills and good working habits

Selected Sec 3 students can take part in the Work Attachment Programme, where they will be attached to partner organisations for a period of one to three days. Before the programme, they will be provided with training and a mentor who will also guide them throughout their work attachment experience. Students who are keen on the programme should indicate their interest when the work attachment programme details are released.
