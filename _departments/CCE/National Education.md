Our school’s NE programmes provide opportunities for our students to explore and examine their identity as Singaporeans and arrive at a common set of ideals and values. The following key dispositions for citizenship in Singapore shape the purpose and approach to NE:

(a)  A Sense of Belonging

(b)  A Sense of Reality

(c)  A Sense of Hope

(d)  A Will to Act

**Curriculum**

The school commemorates four key events. As part of the commemorative events, students will experience NE-CCE lessons, discussions and go through reflections. As part of student leadership development, NE ambassadors will be involved as facilitators or co-planners of activities. The key events are as follows:


(a) Total Defence Day– marking the day in 1942 when Singapore fell to the Japanese. The commemoration serves to remind students that everyone has a part to play in the Total Defence of Singapore.


(b) International Friendship Day – a day dedicated to the understanding of Singapore’s relations with neighbouring countries and beyond. It aims to sensitise our students towards the geo-political realities inherent in Singapore, as well as nurture in our students the spirit of friendship and collaboration among different people.


(c) Racial Harmony Day - marking the day in 1964 when racial riots broke out in Singapore. The commemoration aims to allow students to appreciate diversity and understand that Singapore’s racial and religious harmony cannot be taken for granted.


(d) National Day - marking Singapore’s independence.


In addition to the events, students participate in level-wide Learning Journeys based on different themes:


(a)  Secondary One – Care for the Environment through Geographical and Historical Investigations at Jurong Lake Gardens.


(b)  Secondary Two – Embracing our Culture and Heritage through a Museum-Based experience at National Museum of Singapore.


(c)  Secondary Three – Good Governance and Strong Citizenry through digital learning experiences at the Singapore Sustainable Gallery.


(d)  Secondary Four & Five – Opportunities and Challenges of Singapore through activities at the Singapore Discovery Centre.


Other key NE programmes include the Sec 3 NRIC ceremony where students will appreciate their roles of active citizens through a customized Social Studies package.
