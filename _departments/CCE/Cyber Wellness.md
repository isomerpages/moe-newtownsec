**Cyber Wellness**

**What is Cyber Wellness?**<br>
Cyber wellness refers to the positive well being of Internet users. It involves an understanding of online behaviour and awareness of how to protect oneself and others from harmful risks online.

**Cyber Wellness in NTSS:**

We strive to develop each Newtowner to be able to protect and empower themselves to take responsibility for their own well being in a potentially unpredictable and dangerous cyberspace by propagating and reinforcing Cyberwellness messages through school wide programmes.

In line with the Cyber Wellness Student Ambassador Programme launched by ETD in 2009, NTSS seeks to establish a more rigorous empowerment of students as Cyber Wellness Ambassadors with the motto: 4G “Guiding, Guarding, Growing with Gadgets“

The Cyber Wellness Ambassadors aim to guide their peers to be safe and discerning ICT users and champion cyber wellness efforts in NTSS.

The digital natives will be imparted with the knowledge and skills to:

* adopt good practices to use technology safely and responsibly
* balance the usage of technology for effective learning
* critically evaluate and discern fake news (in alignment with Digital Defence— sixth pillar of Total Defence)
* develop good netiquette and positive use of social media through Peer Support
