**CURRICULUM**

Values in Action (VIA) are learning experiences that support students’ development as socially responsible citizens who contribute meaningfully to the community, through the learning and application of values, knowledge and skills. It places focus on students acquiring values. It encourages students to identify and understand community issues, initiate action with their peers to make a difference to the lives of others. NTSS has a structured and developmental Values Action (VIA) programme, centred around the school value of Care and Concern. Each level works on exhibiting the value of Care and Concern on a specific theme:

<u>**Sec 1: Care and Concern for the School**</u>

Beginning with simple projects like ‘Groom Classroom’ competition, in which students take ownership in creating a conducive learning space in their own classrooms and a minirecyling project within the school at Sec 1, our students learn to show appreciation for their school community first and foremost.

<u>**Sec 2: Care and Concern for the Environment**</u>

At Secondary 2, students start to venture into the community to help increase awareness on environmental issues. This involves producing awareness resources for e.g. brochures for the community on the importance of environmental conservation.

<u>**Sec 3/4/5: Care and Concern for the Community**</u>

At the upper secondary levels, our VIA programme aims to increase the students’ awareness to various community needs and issues, through community partnerships. The upper secondary students learn about service learning, a tool that combines learning objectives with community service in order to provide a real-life learning experience while meeting societal needs.

These partnerships provide opportunities for our students to identify community needs, plan suitable projects to meet these needs, and execute them, Their learning experiences are consolidated though pre-service and post service reflections to ensure a meaningful experience for both students and accompanying teachers
