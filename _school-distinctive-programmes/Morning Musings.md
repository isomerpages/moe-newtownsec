<p>New Town Secondary Schoolâ€™s <strong><em>Morning Musings</em></strong> is
a public speaking platform for students to express themselves cogently
and coherently, lending their student voice in areas which they are passionate
about. They engage their peers in a lively manner while uplifting them
to achieve goals, take on challenges or embrace new ideas. When students
share their personal and school learning experiences, they are motivated
to build ownership in their choices and this inspires student agency, thereby
developing school values such as resilience, self-discipline and care in
them.</p>
