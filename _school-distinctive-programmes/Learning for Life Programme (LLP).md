Starting with mastery of self, every student will be given the opportunity to learn and apply leadership competencies through various learning experiences as part of their leadership journey in New Town Secondary School.

### Our Vision

To develop every Newtowner into confident and compassionate student leaders who are ready to serve and lead their community to overcome challenges of tomorrow

### Key Beliefs

**_(a) Every student can be developed as a leader._**

Every student can be developed as a leader who makes a positive difference to others within his/her sphere of influence.

**_(b) Every student should be developed as a leader._**

All students will be imbued with core values that will anchor them in life and have the opportunity to learn and apply student leadership competencies through Student Development Experiences (SDE), CCA and CCE lessons.

### Desired Outcomes of the Learning For Life Programme

_The school strives to nurture students to become:_

1. Ethical and reflective leaders who show concern for the community;

2. Skilled servant leaders who serve and lead by example; and

3. Empowered contributors who exert positive energy to spheres of influence.

### Whole-School Approach

Every staff in the school is involved in equipping students with leadership competencies and dispositions through “**SPARK**” - an acronym which stands for&nbsp;**Selection, Provision, Affirmation, Reflection and Knowledgeable others.**
