<h4><strong>First Time Use of School Smart Cards for Concessionary Travel for Secondary One Students</strong></h4>
<ol>
<li>
<p>We are pleased to inform you that we have distributed the School Smart
Cards for Secondary One Students via their respective form teachers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Students are required to activate their cards at the TransitLinkTicket
Offices /TransitLink Concession Card Replacement Offices /Passenger Service
Centres (PSCs) at the MRT / Bus Interchanges by topping-up the value for
the card before the SSCs can be used for concessionary travel.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In support of national initiative to steer commuters towards adopting
e-payments in transitticketing, top up at Passenger Services Centre is
progressively ceased. However PSCs will continue to assist in the activation
of concession card for MOE students. To avoid being turned away, students
are advised to inform the PSC staff that they would like to activate their
concession card. The minimum top-up value is $5.</p>

<p>The primary school concessionary card will stop functioning on30 April
