<p>285 and 287 Ghim Moh Road have been proposed to be rezoned ‘Residential
(Subject to Detailed Planning)’ and ‘Road’ in the Draft Master Plan 2025.
The buildings will be demolished to make way for future developments and
supporting infrastructure works.</p>
<p>As these buildings were originally the sites of former Ghim Moh Primary
School and Ghim Moh Secondary School, we warmly invite former students
and staff to take a final walk through the school grounds and revisit cherished
memories before the site is permanently closed for redevelopment.</p>
<p>The site will be open for this purpose on 1 Nov (Sat) morning. Visitors
can drop in any time between 9.00 to 11.00am for a self-guided walk around
the school campus. There will be a booth located at the main foyer on the
day, should you need help or have any queries.</p>
<p>As on-site parking is very limited, you may want to park at Block 8A Ghim
Moh Road (MSPC) if you are driving.</p>
<p>To manage the number of visitors on that day, visitors are to register
with New Town Secondary School using the following link: <a href="https://form.gov.sg/68e4a2718364bbc8a2382f7c" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">https://form.gov.sg/68e4a2718364bbc8a2382f7c</a>
