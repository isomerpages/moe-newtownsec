**Developing critical and inventive thinkers through visual communication**

<u>**Introduction**</u><br>
The Applied Learning Programme (ALP) aims to connect academic knowledge and skills with the real world, emphasizing on application of thinking skills, connecting knowledge across disciplines, stretching the imagination and applying these skills in authentic settings in society and industries.

In New Town Secondary School, we envision our students to be resilient learners who are equipped with critical and inventive thinking skills to prepare them for the challenges and opportunities in a fast-changing world. Through visual communication, students will develop critical and inventive thinking as they are able to view pictures from different perspectives. Students will also have the opportunity to explore various possibilities of visual representations to bring about their intended message.

This programme aims to develop students’ visual expression and language as well as stimulate creativity through photography. The infusion of photography in various subjects such as Science and English enhances their Art experience as they are able to appreciate the interconnectedness between various disciplines and the value of Art in their lives. Together with the education and career guidance (ECG) component, a Newtowner who has gone through the programme will be able to respect different viewpoints and perspectives, and practise photography with passion, integrity and a greater sense of civic responsibility.

We adopt a thematic approach for this programme which focuses on the interdisciplinary nature of photography and the image capturing tools. Learning activities utilise a blended structure which are held during curriculum lessons as well as through selected enrichment.
