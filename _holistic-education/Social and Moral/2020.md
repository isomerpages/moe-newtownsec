# Learn For Life 2020 (NTSS in the Media)

To prepare our students for an increasingly complex, interconnected and tech-driven world, the Ministry of Education (MOE) will build on existing efforts to help them be agile and future-ready, regardless of their backgrounds and starting points in life. To do so, the Ministry will embark on the next phase in our 'Learn for Life' movement through two additional thrusts – 'Refreshing our Curriculum' and 'SkillsFuture for Educators' – to enhance students' learning and support educators in nurturing future-ready learners.

Minister's Visit During the Refresh of Character Citizenship Education (CCE) Curriculum
"A class of about 30 students from New Town Secondary School gathered last Tuesday (Feb 25) to watch a video about cyber bullying. At various points, their teacher paused the video, asking them what they would do and getting them to place their votes for different actions.

The video portrays a group of schoolmates, one of whom is being bullied online and offline by another character and her friends, while a mutual friend mulls over what he should do.

In class, the teacher showed the Secondary 2 students various scenarios that play out, and probed them to think. They raised their hands, spoke their minds and laughed as they shared their thoughts."  **(The Straits Times, 04/03/2020)**
