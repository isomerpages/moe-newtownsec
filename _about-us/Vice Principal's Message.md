**Vice-Principals' Message**

New Town Secondary School’s vision of “Nurturing Talents, Sharing Success” is anchored on our belief that every student is unique and talented in his or her own way.  This education philosophy guides us to see the potential in all our students, nurture their talents and help them realize their aspirations.

It takes a village to raise a child, and we are grateful for our many supportive stakeholders and partners who continually contribute in one way or another to provide varied and holistic learning experiences for our students bringing out the best in them.

Our Parent Support Group (PSG) work together with the school to support the learning and development of students. Through active participation in schools events and providing invaluable feedback for improvement, students have the strong home support to grow and develop through their formative years. 

We have a committed alumni who are always ready to give back to their alma mater. Many of them are well-established in various fields and have shared their experiences and expertise with our students to widen their horizons and help them to be future-ready. We look forward to them “Sharing Success” through inspiring their juniors to achieve their aspirations and also become useful citizens who make positive contributions to our nation.    

Our industry and community partners are very supportive of our school’s programmes, including our Learning for Life Programme (LLP) in Community Youth Leadership. Students are given learning opportunities for our students to develop their leadership and character during their Service Learning and Work Attachment Programme, enabling them to make connections between what they learn in school and learning and exposure that they will pick up beyond the school.    

It is indeed a privilege to be part of the New Town family.  Together with teachers, parents, and community partners, I look forward to helping our students achieve their aspirations and dreams.   Education is the human enterprise of paying it forward!

Warm Regards<br>
