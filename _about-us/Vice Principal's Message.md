**Vice-Principals' Message**

New Town Secondary School’s vision of “Nurturing Talents, Sharing Success” is anchored on our belief that every student is unique and talented in his or her own way.  This education philosophy guides us to see the potential in all our students, nurture their talents and help them realize their aspirations.

It takes a village to raise a child, and we are grateful for our many supportive stakeholders and partners who continually contribute in one way or another to provide varied and holistic learning experiences for our students bringing out the best in them.

Our Parent Support Group (PSG) work together with the school to support the learning and development of students. Through active participation in schools events and providing invaluable feedback for improvement, students have the strong home support to grow and develop through their formative years. 

We have a committed alumni who are always ready to give back to their alma mater. Many of them are well-established in various fields and have shared their experiences and expertise with our students to widen their horizons and help them to be future-ready. We look forward to them “Sharing Success” through inspiring their juniors to achieve their aspirations and also become useful citizens who make positive contributions to our nation.    

Our industry and community partners are very supportive of our school’s programmes, including our Learning for Life Programme (LLP) in Community Youth Leadership. Students are given learning opportunities for our students to develop their leadership and character during their Service Learning and Work Attachment Programme, enabling them to make connections between what they learn in school and learning and exposure that they will pick up beyond the school.    

It is indeed a privilege to be part of the New Town family.  Together with teachers, parents, and community partners, I look forward to helping our students achieve their aspirations and dreams.   Education is the human enterprise of paying it forward!

Warm Regards<br>

A wise man once said, “Education is the passport to the future, for tomorrow belongs to those who prepare for it today.” It is with such a mindset and philosophy that I believe is what drives us here at New Town Secondary School. We believe that every student wants to learn and that forms the core of what we do here. We do this by helping your children discover and nurture their strengths and talents, developing and prepare them holistically for the challenges of tomorrow.

We endeavour for every Newtowner in our care to be provided with the tools and experiences to encourage and empower them to be thinkers, knowing how to differentiate between right and wrong and knowing what is best for themselves and the people around them. The opportunities here at NTSS will help our students grow in their resilience, compassion and confidence in becoming leaders that they are and in service to their family, community and nation. Our motto, ‘To Forge a Better Life’, continues to guide both educators and students in their path forward in our efforts as a school. 

 One specialised area in which we aim to equip our students with is visual communication. With the world rapidly moving into the digital realm, our students need to be able to utilise and present information and data efficiently and effectively to create meaning. Equipping our students with such critical and inventive skills will ready them to take the lead in Singapore’s knowledge-based economy. 


In making NTSS’ vision a reality, our committed educators are continually developing themselves through focused training and professional guidance. We are confident that your children and our students will be cared for and guided by our educators, enabling them to grow to their fullest potential and be active citizens in society.
Together, let us nurture our youths to be ready for the challenges of the future!

Warm Regards<br>
