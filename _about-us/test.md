#### **Mr Koh Yiak Kheng, Leonard**

**Principal’s Message 2023**

In Marsiling Secondary School, we believe that every child has talents and the capacity to learn and excel. The school’s approach to designing our curriculum is thus guided by this belief and seeks to meet the needs of Marsilians by providing them with various platforms and opportunities to develop as well as express their unique talents while learning new knowledge and skills.

To support the children’s learning, the school places great emphasis on creating a conducive learning environment. Besides the state-of-the-art physical infrastructure that was specially designed to support teaching and learning, our students are also immersed in a caring and nurturing social environment which is critical to their wellbeing and character development.

As the saying goes, it takes a village to raise a child. We are very fortunate to have a strong team of competent and dedicated staff who are always prepared to go the extra mile to help our students learn and grow. We are also very grateful to be supported by many committed partners such as the School’s Advisory Committee, Parent Support Group, Alumni and community partners. I am happy to share that the entire ‘kampong’ is ready to support us in raising our children in the Marsiling Family.

A Japanese philosopher once shared, “_One who lights the lantern for another, brightens his own way._” There is rich wisdom behind this quote. Besides strengthening our children’s academic learning, Marsiling Secondary has also been actively providing opportunities for our children to work with community partners to contribute to the neighbourhood. Through such projects, our children are able to contribute actively to the development of the community, whilst inculcating the important school core values of Respect, Responsibility and Resilience, hence strengthening their character.

Please feel free to browse through our school’s website for a more comprehensive understanding of the dynamic curriculum and exciting developmental opportunities offered at Marsiling Secondary School. Happy surfing!
