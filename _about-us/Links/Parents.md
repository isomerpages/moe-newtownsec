# Direct School Admission – Secondary (DSA-Sec) Exercise 2022


DSA-Sec is an MOE initiative designed to give schools greater flexibility in student admission, in order to allow for the recognition and development of a more diverse range of student achievements and talents beyond academic achievements.

We are looking for interested Primary 6 pupils with talents/skills in **Student Leadership, Art, and/or Fencing** for admission to Secondary One in 2023.

**DSA – Student Leadership**

Students who possess positive attitude, good communication skills and have demonstrated leadership capabilities, such as leading others in planning and carrying out school events or level-wide programmes, may wish to take part in our DSA-Student Leadership.

At New Town Secondary School, students will attend leadership development programmes through self-mastery and team-based activities. Students will have an opportunity to hone their leadership competencies and be empowered to lead through school and level-wide programmes. They will apply and hone their leadership skills through authentic learning platforms.

**DSA – Art**

Students with talent and interest in Art can look forward to having the opportunity to develop their creative talent and ability through our Lower Secondary Art Programme as well as the Co-Curricular Activity- Art and Crafts Club. 

Our curriculum and programmes provide exposure and experience to a wide range of materials and medium - dry to wet medium, digital photography to animation, learning opportunities with creative professionals and alumnus, as well as platforms for like-minded students to meet and grow together. 

**DSA – Fencing**

Students with talent and interest in Fencing can look forward to having the opportunity to develop their sporting talent and ability through our Fencing CCA. 

Fencing aims to nurture students with positive attitude to learn and improve through competitive sports, and to enable them to demonstrate greater competence in the areas of self-management, self-awareness, responsible decision-making, social awareness and relationship management.

If you think you have what it takes, do apply to join our school through our DSA-Student Leadership, DSA-Art, and/or DSA-Fencing

Parents and students are encouraged to choose schools wisely based on the student’s aptitudes and strengths, bearing in mind the schools’ academic and non-academic requirements, and the programmes available to develop the area of talent Students who are successfully admitted to the school via DSA are expected to honour their commitment to the school, and participate in the activities related to the talent they are selected for from year 1-4.
