**Enhanced MOE Financial Assistance Scheme (FAS)**

**With effect from 1 April 2018**, students from households with gross monthly income of **$2,750** and below will be eligible for the FAS.  For households with monthly income in excess of **$2,750**, students can still be considered for the FAS if there are five or more members in the household (comprising parents, unmarried siblings, grandparents and other dependents) and the per capita income is **$690** or less.

For example,<br>
A household, with a monthly income of **$3000**, has 5 members staying in the same place.
The family members are father, mother, grandfather, the child and another sibling.
Its per capita income would be **$3000/ 5 = $660.**
This household will qualify for the FAS.

FAS recipients are not required to pay school fees and standard miscellaneous fees. FAS recipients are also eligible for free textbooks and school attire.

Please approach the school general office for the application form and further information or click [here](https://www.moe.gov.sg/financial-matters/financial-assistance) for further information.
