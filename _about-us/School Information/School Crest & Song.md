***创造美好生活***

***TO FORGE A BETTER LIFE***

The badge embodies the name of the school in both English and Chinese. It is in three colours: white, black and red. Each colour symbolizes certain attributes in a person.

**White** – Purity, Sincerity and Honesty

**Black** – Perseverance and Steadfastness

**Red** – Aspirations, Warmth and Unity

At the centre of the badge is a flower which is made up of many petals encircling a cog-wheel. The flower stands for scholastic achievement while the cog-wheel signifies the nation’s progress and development. Education is the inculcation of all tbe above attributes.  It is hoped that with these qualities, a Newtowner will be able to forge a better future for himself and contribute to the nation’s progress and development.
