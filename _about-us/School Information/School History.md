**The 1960s and 1970s - Forging a Better Life**
![](/images/old%20school%20pic%20.png)

New Town Secondary School was founded on 2 January 1965, the same year Singapore gained its independence. It was the 68th Secondary School to be opened by the Singapore government. The School was set up to meet the needs of the residents staying in the Queenstown district, many of whom comprised school-going children who were about to embark on secondary education. It was tentatively known as Queensway’s Third Secondary School then.

In its first year there were 45 classes, 1819 pupils and 73 teachers. New Town’s first batch of pupils were made up of 2 classes of Secondary One pupils, 20 classes of Secondary Two and Three Chinese Stream pupils from Hwa Yi Secondary School and Tanglin Technical Secondary School, and 13 classes of Secondary Two, Three and Four English Stream pupils from Queensway Secondary School.

On 7th January 1965, Mrs. Yeo Lai Cheng was appointed by the Ministry Of Education as the School’s first principal. A few months later, the School came to be officially known as New Town Secondary School.

**The First Batch of Teaching Staff (1966)**

On 17 September 1966, New Town Secondary School had its official opening ceremony. The Member of Parliament for Queenstown, Mr Jek Yuen Tong, was the Guest-of-Honour for the ceremony.

To make the school distinctive, Mrs. Yeo crafted the School’s motto, “To Forge A Better Life”. It was her vision that all New Towners will forge ahead for a better life for the country, their loved ones and themselves after undergoing a holistic education in New Town Secondary School. Mr See Chin Chuang, her Senior Assistant, designed the School’s uniform, flag and badge based on Mrs. Yeo’s vision.

By 1968, the School was well-established. It was one of the first schools in Singapore to provide bilingual education to its pupils, as advocated by the government in 1966.

Technical education was introduced in 1969. Its purpose was to prepare the pupils for an important role in the industrialisation programmes of Singapore, an option whichthe young Republic had to take to ensure her economic survival.

To generate a sense of pride and a sense of belonging among the pupils, Mrs. Yeo Lai Cheng penned the lyrics of the School Song which expressed the aspirations she had for the School. It was completed with the contribution of Miss Koh Wai Choo who composed the School Song. The lyrics were also translated into Chinese by Professor Jao Yu Wei.

1969 saw a structural change in the development of New Town Secondary School. It was the year when neighboring Baharuddin Vocational School was merged with the school to create the largest bi-lateral integrated school in Singapore with an enrolment of 3027 pupils. There were 81 classes and 148 teachers. To cope with the increase in the size of the School, the post of Vice-Principal was created. The first Vice-Principal of the School was Mr. Adrian De Silva.

In May 1971, the School Advisory Committee decided on the construction of a sports track. President Benjamin Sheares came to the School on 20 July 1971 to plant a tree to commemorate the building of the sports track.

In 1974, the construction of the School’s track and grandstand commenced and was completed a year later. On 2 May 1975, Mr. Ahmad Mattar, Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of Education, officiated the opening ceremony of the School’s athletics track. In 1975, New Town Secondary School was the largest secondary school in Singapore with an enrolment of 3540 pupils in 92 classes and 163 staff
