<h3><u>Comments from Mr Nigel Phang (Vice Principal, Zhenghua Primary School)</u></h3>

"I observed that they have lived up to be good students, giving their best in being concerned citizens &amp; active contributors, playing an active role as advocates for this world to make it greener &amp; sustainable for all of us present and future!

They have been very responsible and sensible girls which the school would be proud off. I am very impressed by their conduct, behavior &amp; presentation!

Your school has done well to prepare them to be global citizens.‚Äù
