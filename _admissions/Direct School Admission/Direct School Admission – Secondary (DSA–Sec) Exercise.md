<p>Parents and students are encouraged to choose schools wisely based on
the student’s aptitudes and strengths, bearing in mind the schools’ academic
and non-academic requirements, and the programmes available to develop
the area of talent. Students who are successfully admitted to the school
via DSA are expected to honour their commitment to the school, and participate
in the activities related to the talent they are selected for from year
1-4.</p>
