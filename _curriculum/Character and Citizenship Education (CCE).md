<p><strong>CHARACTER &amp; CITIZENSHIP EDUCATION</strong>
</p>
<p>New Town Secondary School adopts a whole-school approach in its Character
and Citizenship Education. The explicit teaching of values and social-emotional
skills is conducted mainly through the CCE lessons, as well as other curriculum
subjects where the teaching of values and social-emotional skills are infused
in the lesson objectives. To enable students to exhibit and apply values
and SE skills, the school provides intentional, coherent and student-centric
student development experiences (SDEs) to develop them into confident leaners
and caring leaders.</p>
<p><strong>CCE Programme</strong>
</p>
<p>The CCE programme in New Town Secondary School is aligned to the MOE’s
CCE 2021 Curriculum Framework. Reflected in the curriculum content, it
covers dynamic content areas like Education and Career Guidance, Cyber
Wellness, National Education, Mental health, Family Education and Sexuality
Education. The CCE curriculum also covers explicit teaching of school values
and social-emotional skills, in ways that are age-appropriate and meaningful
for our students.. The CCE programme focuses on the Three Big Ideas: Identity,
Relationships and Choices. Values education is also infused in the various
subjects to reflect the teaching of school values and social-emotional
skills.</p>
<p><strong>Citizenship</strong>
</p>
<p>Students are provided with opportunities to contribute to the well-being
of the community and nation building through the school’s National Education
(NE) and Values-in-Action (VIA) programmes. Through the four NE events:
namely the Total Defence Day, International Friendship Day, Racial Harmony
Day, and National Day, the school empowers students to share&nbsp; different
perspectives on national issues and concerns, and advocate for student
agency. Through VIA programme, students plan and execute projects based
on the IPARD/C process: investigate community needs, therein contributing
to the betterment of the community.</p>
<p><strong>Gratitude Practices</strong>
</p>
<p>As part of the school’s efforts in developing a positive school culture
and well-being, NTSS’ Gratitude Practices encourage staff and students
to inculcate the habit and attitude of gratitude. Platforms and time are
set aside to allow staff and students to share their gratitude stories
with the school population.</p>
<p><strong>Care for Students with Special Needs</strong>
</p>
<p>The school supports student learning and experience for students with
special needs. The SEN committee is set up to identify and meet the learning
needs of these students.</p>
<p><strong>Care for International Students and Permanent Residents (ISPRs)</strong>
</p>
<p>The school supports and integrates international students and permanent
residents into the school community through the ISPR Committee. Induction
and Integration programmes are organised by the committee to help ISPRs
enjoy a smooth transition and integration into the country / school culture,
and at the same time, allow them to form genuine and long-lasting friendships
with local students.</p>
