**CHARACTER & CITIZENSHIP EDUCATION**

New Town Secondary School adopts a whole-school approach in its Character and Citizenship Education. The explicit teaching of values and social-emotional skills is conducted mainly through the CCE lessons, as well as other curriculum subjects where the teaching of values and social-emotional skills are infused in the lesson objectives. To enable students to exhibit and apply values and SE skills, the school provides intentional, coherent and student-centric student development experiences (SDEs) to develop them into confident leaners and caring leaders. 

**CCE Programme**

The CCE programme in New Town Secondary School is aligned to the MOE’s CCE 2021 Curriculum Framework. Reflected in the curriculum content, it covers dynamic content areas like Education and Career Guidance, Cyber Wellness, National Education, Mental health, Family Education and Sexuality Education. The CCE curriculum also covers explicit teaching of school values and social-emotional skills, in ways that are age-appropriate and meaningful for our students.. The CCE programme focuses on the Three Big Ideas: Identity, Relationships and Choices. Values education is also infused in the various subjects to reflect the teaching of school values and social-emotional skills.

**Citizenship**

Students are provided with opportunities to contribute to the well-being of the community and nation building through the school’s National Education (NE) and Values-in-Action (VIA) programmes. Through the four NE events: namely the Total Defence Day, International Friendship Day, Racial Harmony Day, and National Day, the school empowers students to share  different perspectives on national issues and concerns, and advocate for student agency. Through VIA programme, students plan and execute projects based on the IPARD/C process: investigate community needs, therein contributing to the betterment of the community.

**Gratitude Practices**

As part of the school’s efforts in developing a positive school culture and well-being, NTSS’ Gratitude Practices encourage staff and students to inculcate the habit and attitude of gratitude. Platforms and time are set aside to allow staff and students to share their gratitude stories with the school population.

**Care for Students with Special Needs**

The school supports student learning and experience for students with special needs. The SEN committee is set up to identify and meet the learning needs of these students.

**Care for International Students and Permanent Residents (ISPRs)**

The school supports and integrates international students and permanent residents into the school community through the ISPR Committee. Induction and Integration programmes are organised by the committee to help ISPRs enjoy a smooth transition and integration into the country / school culture, and at the same time, allow them to form genuine and long-lasting friendships with local students.
