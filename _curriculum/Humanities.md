<h3>KEY FOCUS</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>To nurture students to develop knowledge, skills, values and dispositions
to examine global issues;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To nurture students to develop an understanding and appreciation of diverse
perspectives, cultures and experiences of others; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To nurture students to have sound and reasoned decision-making by providing
opportunities for a critical examination of different perspectives through
the inquiry approach.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>PROGRAMMES</h3>
<p><strong>Core Programme</strong>
</p>
<p>In&nbsp;<strong>Geography</strong>, students will learn about the relationships
between environments and people. They will explore local and global issues,
such as climate change and resource depletion through learning experiences
such as fieldwork. Students will be able to find out more about the challenges
faced across the world in managing resource use sustainably and how stakeholders
involved develop solutions for sustainable development.</p>
<p><strong>History</strong>&nbsp;helps students understand the human experience
and societies across time. As students learn about key historical developments,
different cultures and the experiences of others, students will be able
to make sense of present-day local and global issues. Being able to appreciate
the past and the perspectives of others will also help students to relate
to people of diverse backgrounds and cultures.</p>
<p><strong>Social Studies</strong>&nbsp;allows students to inquire into contemporary
societal issues in the local and global context through classroom discussions
and examination of sources of different forms and types. Students will
appreciate multiple perspectives and the importance of cultural diversity
and develop the agency to respond to pertinent societal issues.</p>
