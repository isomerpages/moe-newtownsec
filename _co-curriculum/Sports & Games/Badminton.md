<h1>INTRODUCTION</h1>
<p>The NTSS Badminton CCA consists of both girls and boys team. The West
Zone Badminton Tournament is the annual highlight, in which the team competes
in singles and double matches under the ‘B’ and ‘C’ divisions.</p>
<p>The team trains on a weekly basis, under the guidance of experienced Coaches
and Teachers-in-charge. During the trainings, the team gets to learn a
variety of badminton tactics, strokes and footwork. Trainings also include
strength and agility conditioning exercises which help members improve
on their individual proficiency. The CCA also aimed to shape every badminton
player into self-driven, self-disciplined and resilient individuals. The
team aspires to play to the best of their abilities while emphasising on
the value of sportsmanship and teamwork.</p>
