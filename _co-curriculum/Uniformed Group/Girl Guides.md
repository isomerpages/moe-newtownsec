# INTRODUCTION
<u>Mission</u><br>
To enable girls and young women to develop their fullest potential as responsible citizens of the world.

<u>Vision</u><br>
We are a growing worldwide Movement ~ the voice of girls and young women who influence issues they care about and build a better world.

<u>The Guide Motto “Be Prepared”</u><br>
The initials of the GGS motto, “Be Prepared”, also happens to be our Founder’s initials and is a practical reminder of the purpose of Girl Guiding which is to always be prepared for any eventuality. We carry out many activities that encompass the five modules in guiding – social and personal development, home, outdoor, knowledge of community and international. We also strive to be proficient in specific life skills that enable us to be prepared for the future.
