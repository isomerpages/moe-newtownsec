# INTRODUCTION
New Town NPCC Unit was established in 1966. We aim to provide holistic training to our cadets with emphasis on quality leadership development and character building. This is echoed by the Unit’s Motto – Nurturing Potential, Cultivating Characters.

New Town NPCC has achieved at least 20 GOLD Awards since 1996. We have performed consistently well in all of NPCC HQ Inter-Unit Competitions: Campcraft Competition, .22 Revolver Shooting Competition and Inter-Unit Drill Competition. We are also involved in community services both locally and overseas. To date, New Town NPCC have conducted adventure, community service and education trips to Malaysia, Indonesia, Thailand, Nepal, Hong Kong and Australia.
