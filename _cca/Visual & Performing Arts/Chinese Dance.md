# Introduction

Chinese Dance of New Town Secondary School aims to expose students to different kinds of dance forms and allow them to appreciate the rhythm and essence of beautiful dances. As dancers, the common aspiration is to be able to shine on stage. In addition, a true dancer will also be passionate about dancing and possess the right attitude.

Dance trains the students in body coordination, mental concentration and most importantly, the spirit of teamwork. Dance also teaches the students to be self-disciplined and resilient as they constantly strive to perfect their moves. These attributes will be the assets that New Town dancers possess.
