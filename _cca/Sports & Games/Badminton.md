# INTRODUCTION

The NTSS Badminton CCA consists of both girls and boys team. The West Zone Badminton Tournament is the annual highlight, in which the team competes in singles and double matches under the ‘B’ and ‘C’ divisions.

The team trains on a weekly basis, under the guidance of experienced Coaches and Teachers-in-charge. During the trainings, the team gets to learn a variety of badminton tactics, strokes and footwork. Trainings also include strength and agility conditioning exercises which help members improve on their individual proficiency. The CCA also aimed to shape every badminton player into self-driven, self-disciplined and resilient individuals. The team aspires to play to the best of their abilities while emphasising on the value of sportsmanship and teamwork.
