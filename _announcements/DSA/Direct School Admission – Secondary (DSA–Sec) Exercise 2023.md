### What is Direct School Admission?

&nbsp;DSA-Sec is an MOE initiative designed to give schools greater flexibility in student admission, to allow for the recognition and development of a more diverse range of student achievements and talents beyond academic achievements.

&nbsp;We are looking for interested Primary 6 students with talents/passion/skills in&nbsp;**Leadership, Visual Arts, Fencing, Basketball**&nbsp;and/or&nbsp;**Guzheng**&nbsp;for admission to Secondary One in 2024.
